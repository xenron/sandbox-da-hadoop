This directory contains the data files and code for all recipes in the book.

Generally, the hql files can be executed by Hive using the '-f' flag.  Using the verbose '-v' flag is also recommended.

For example,

  $ hive -v -f 01_tables_and_queries.hql

The 03_*.hql files are auxiliary files to the 03_using_hive_noninteractively.sh script to illustrate the usage of Hive from the command line.

The 07_using_static_partitions.sh file should be run before executing 07_using_static_partitions.hql to put the required data files in HDFS.

The compile.sh script will compile and package the user code in this directory and should be run before executing the code for scripts 06 or 11-14.

Please make sure that the *.rb files are executable prior to executing 10_adding_custom_logic_with_streaming.hql.

All files should be executed from this directory.

Data files are located in the data subdirectory.
