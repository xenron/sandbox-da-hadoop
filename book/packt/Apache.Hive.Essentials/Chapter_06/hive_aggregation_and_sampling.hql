--Apache Hive Essentials
--Chapter 6 Code - Hive Data Aggregation and Sampling

--Aggregation without GROUP BY columns
SELECT count(*) AS row_cnt FROM employee;

--Aggregation with GROUP BY columns
SELECT sex_age.sex, count(*) AS row_cnt FROM employee 
GROUP BY sex_age.sex;

--The column age is not in the group by columns, 
--FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10002]: Line 1:15 Invalid column reference 'age'
--SELECT sex_age.age, sex_age.sex, count(*) AS row_cnt 
--FROM employee GROUP BY sex_age.sex;

--Find row count by sex and random age for each sex
SELECT sex_age.sex,collect_set(sex_age.age)[0] AS random_age, 
count(*) AS row_cnt FROM employee GROUP BY sex_age.sex;

--Multiple aggregate functions are called in the same SELECT
SELECT sex_age.sex, AVG(sex_age.age) AS avg_age, 
count(*) AS row_cnt FROM employee GROUP BY sex_age.sex; 

--Aggregate functions are used with CASE WHEN 
SELECT sum(CASE WHEN sex_age.sex = 'Male' THEN sex_age.age
ELSE 0 END)/count(CASE WHEN sex_age.sex = 'Male' THEN 1 
ELSE NULL END) AS male_age_avg FROM employee;

--Aggregate functions are used with COALESCE and IF 
SELECT
sum(coalesce(sex_age.age,0)) AS age_sum,
sum(if(sex_age.sex = 'Female',sex_age.age,0)) 
AS female_age_sum FROM employee;

--Nested aggregate functions are not allowed
--FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10128]: Line 1:11 Not yet supported place for UDAF 'count'
--SELECT avg(count(*)) AS row_cnt FROM employee;                    

--Aggregate functions can be also used with DISTINCT keyword to do aggregation on unique values.
SELECT count(distinct sex_age.sex) AS sex_uni_cnt,
count(distinct name) AS name_uni_cnt FROM employee;     

--Trigger single reducer during the whole processing
SELECT count(distinct sex_age.sex) AS sex_uni_cnt FROM employee;

--Use subquery to select unique value before aggregations for better performance
SELECT count(*) AS sex_uni_cnt FROM (SELECT distinct sex_age.sex FROM employee) a;

--Aggregation across columns with NULL value.
--Prepare a table for testing
CREATE TABLE t
AS
SELECT * FROM
(SELECT employee_id-99 AS val1, (employee_id-98) AS val2 FROM employee_hr 
WHERE employee_id <= 101
UNION ALL
SELECT null val1, 2 AS val2 FROM employee_hr 
WHERE employee_id = 100) a;

--Check the table rows 
SELECT * FROM t;

--The 2nd row (NULL, 2) are ignored when doing sum(val1+val2)
SELECT sum(val1), sum(val1+val2) FROM t;                   

SELECT sum(coalesce(val1,0)), sum(coalesce(val1,0)+val2) FROM t;

--hive.map.aggr property controls whether to do aggregations in the map task. 
SET hive.map.aggr=true;

--GROUPING__ID
SELECT GROUPING__ID, 
BIN(CAST(GROUPING__ID AS BIGINT)) AS bit_vector, 
name, start_date, count(employee_id) emp_id_cnt 
FROM employee_hr 
GROUP BY start_date, name WITH CUBE ORDER BY start_date;

--Aggregation condition â€“ HAVING
SELECT sex_age.age FROM employee 
GROUP BY sex_age.age HAVING count(*)<=1;

--If we do not use HAVING, we can use subquery as follows. 
SELECT a.age
FROM
(SELECT count(*) as cnt, sex_age.age 
FROM employee GROUP BY sex_age.age
) a WHERE a.cnt<=1;
