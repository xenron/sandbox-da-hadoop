Hello Susan, Thank you very much for your email and introduction. It seems you are doing a lot of good things with Spark, Hadoop and Big data. I would recommend you take a look at Spark (spark.apache.org) as well. All of the source code and bonus chapters are posted at the GitHub:  If I can be any further help on Spark, please let me know.
Hello Alex, I read your advanced Spark book on machine learning and it is very intersting that you talk about linear regression and logistic algorithms: these algorithms will help to unlock the power of genome for the whole world, thanks.
