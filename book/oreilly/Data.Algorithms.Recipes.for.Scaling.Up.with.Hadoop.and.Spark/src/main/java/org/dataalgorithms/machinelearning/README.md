Machine Learning Algorithms using Spark
=======================================
The purpose of these packages (solutions expressed in Java 
and Spark) are to show how to implement basic machine learning 
algorithms (K-Means, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, ...) 
in Spark and Spark's MLlib library.  Spark's MLlib offers a 
suite of machine learning libraries for 

* Naive Bayes
* Logistic Regression
* K-Means
* Linear Regression

Machine Learning vs. Traditional Programming
============================================

* "Machine learning is a subfield of computer science that evolved 
  from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning 
  theory in artificial intelligence.  Machine learning explores the 
  study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make 
  predictions on data. Such algorithms operate by building a model 
  from example inputs in order to make data-driven predictions or 
  decisions, rather than following strictly static program instructions."
  (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

* "Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without 
  being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has 
  given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective 
  web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. 
  Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens 
  of times a day without knowing it."

K-Means Clustering Algorithm
============================
K-Means clustering is a clustering algorithm that can be used to partition 
your dataset into K (where K > 1) clusters. We now look at how we can implement 
K-Means clustering using Spark to cluster the featurized Wikipedia dataset. 
K-Means is one of the simplest un-supervised learning algorithms that solve 
the well known clustering problem.

K-Means using Spark's MLlib
===========================
* org.dataalgorithms.machinelearning.kmeans.Featurization
  
  This is a standalone Spark program to featurize the WikiStats
 
* org.dataalgorithms.machinelearning.kmeans.WikipediaKMeansUsingUtilVector

  This solution implements K-Means algorithm using the org.apache.spark.util.Vector class

* org.dataalgorithms.machinelearning.kmeans.WikipediaKMeansUsingMLlibVector

  This solution implements K-Means algorithm using the org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.Vector interface


Logistic Regression Algorithm
=============================
Use simple logistic regression when you have one nominal variable 
and one measurement variable, and you want to know whether variation 
in the measurement variable causes variation in the nominal variable.

Logistic Regression Applications using Spark's MLlib
====================================================

Breast Cancer Detection
-----------------------
These Spark programs detect breast cancer using Logistic Regression model 

* org.dataalgorithms.machinelearning.logistic.BreastCancerDetectionBuildModel

The class ````BreastCancerDetectionBuildModel```` builds the model from the given training data

* org.dataalgorithms.machinelearning.logistic.BreastCancerDetection

This is the driver class, which uses the built model to classify new queried data
 
Detect Spam and Non-Spam Emails
-------------------------------
  
This solution detects spam and non-spam emails

* org.dataalgorithms.machinelearning.logistic.EmailSpamDetectionBuildModel

The class ````EmailSpamDetectionBuildModel```` builds the model from the given training data

* org.dataalgorithms.machinelearning.logistic.EmailSpamDetection

This is the driver class, which uses the built model to classify new queried data



Naive Bayes Algorithm
===================== 
"The Naive Bayes algorithm is an intuitive method that uses the probabilities of 
each attribute belonging to each class to make a prediction. It is the supervised 
learning approach you would come up with if you wanted to model a predictive modeling 
problem probabilistically.  Naive Bayes simplifies the calculation of probabilities 
by assuming that the probability of each attribute belonging to a given class value 
is independent of all other attributes. This is a strong assumption but results in a 
fast and effective method." 
(source: http://machinelearningmastery.com/naive-bayes-classifier-scratch-python/)


Naive Bayes Classifier can be specified by using the following conditional 
probabilities:

````
P(a|b) = (P(b|a) P(a)) / P(b)
````

Naive Bayes Applications using Spark's MLlib
============================================
The following Spark classes may be used to implement Naive Bayes:

* org.apache.spark.mllib.classification.NaiveBayes
Trains a Naive Bayes model given an RDD of (label, features) pairs.   

* org.apache.spark.mllib.classification.NaiveBayesModel
Model for Naive Bayes Classifiers
   
Linear Regression
=================
Regression analysis is the art and science of fitting straight lines 
to patterns of data. Linear regression is a simple approach to supervised 
learning. It assumes that the dependence of Y on X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, 
..., X<sub>n</sub> is linear. In reality, true regression functions are 
never linear.
