I had an honor an privilege of signing my book at #SparkSummit 2015. 
I want to say big thank you to all who waited in the line to get a 
signed copy. What a fantastic group of engineers and data scientists! 
I was amazed a and learned a lot from this group. Please note that the 
signed copy has only the first 5 chapters.
